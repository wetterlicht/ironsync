name: Companion Endure Harm
type: Suffer

When **your companion faces physical damage**, they suffer -health equal to the amount of harm inflicted. If your companion’s health is 0, exchange any leftover -health for -momentum.
Then, roll +heart or +your companion’s health, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, your companion rallies. Give them +1 health.

On a **weak hit**, your companion is battered. If their health is 0, they cannot assist you until they gain at least +1 health.

On a **miss**, also suffer -1 momentum. If your companion’s health is 0, they are gravely wounded and out of action. Without aid, they die in an hour or two.

If you roll a miss with a 1 on your action die, and your companion’s health is 0, they are now dead. Take 1 experience for each marked ability on your companion asset, and remove it.
