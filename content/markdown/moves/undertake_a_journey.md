When **you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar lands**, set the rank of your journey.

- Troublesome journey: 3 progress per waypoint.
- Dangerous journey: 2 progress per waypoint.
- Formidable journey: 1 progress per waypoint.
- Extreme journey: 2 ticks per waypoint.
- Epic journey: 1 tick per waypoint.

Then, for each segment of your journey, roll +wits. If you are setting off from a community with which you share a bond, add +1 to your initial roll.

On a **strong hit**, you reach a waypoint. If the waypoint is unknown to you, envision it (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure). Then, choose one.

- You make good use of your resources: Mark progress.
- You move at speed: Mark progress and take +1 momentum, but suffer -1 supply.

On a **weak hit**, you reach a waypoint and mark progress, but suffer -1 supply.

On a **miss**, you are waylaid by a perilous event. _Pay the Price_.
