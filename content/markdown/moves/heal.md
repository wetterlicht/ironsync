When **you treat an injury or ailment**, roll +wits. If you are mending your own wounds, roll +wits or +iron, whichever is lower.

On a **strong hit**, your care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) have the wounded condition, you may clear it. Then, take or give up to +2 health.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must suffer -1 supply or -1 momentum (your choice).

On a **miss**, your aid is ineffective. _Pay the Price_.
