When **you are brought to the brink of desolation**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you resist and press on.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

- Your spirit or sanity breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
- You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and _Swear an Iron Vow_ (formidable or extreme) to prevent it. If you fail to score a hit when you _Swear an Iron Vow_, or refuse the quest, you are lost. Otherwise, you return to your senses and are now tormented. You may only clear the tormented debility by completing the quest.

On a **miss**, you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.
