When **you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is lost to you**, clear the vow and _Endure Stress_. You suffer -spirit equal to the rank of your quest (troublesome=1; dangerous=2; formidable=3; extreme=4; epic=5).
If the vow was made to a person or community with whom you share a bond, _Test Your Bond_ when you next meet.
