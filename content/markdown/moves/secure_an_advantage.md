When **you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage**, envision your action and roll. If you act...

- With speed, agility, or precision: Roll +edge.
- With charm, loyalty, or courage: Roll +heart.
- With aggressive action, forceful defense, strength, or endurance: Roll +iron.
- With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow.
- With expertise, insight, or observation: Roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, you gain advantage. Choose one.

- Take control: Make another move now (not a progress move), and add +1.
- Prepare to act: Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, your advantage is short-lived. Take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. _Pay the Price_.
