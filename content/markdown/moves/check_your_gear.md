When **you check to see if you have a specific helpful item**, and you have at least +1 supply, roll +supply.

On a **strong hit**, you have it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you have it, but your resources are diminished. Take +1 momentum and suffer -1 supply.

On a **miss**, you donâ€™t have it and the situation grows more perilous. _Pay the Price_.
