name: Endure Stress
type: Suffer

When **you face mental shock or despair**, suffer -spirit equal to your foeâ€™s rank or as appropriate to the situation. If your spirit is 0, suffer -momentum equal to any remaining -spirit.
Then, roll +spirit or +heart, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

- Shake it off: If your spirit is greater than 0, suffer -1 momentum in exchange for +1 spirit
- Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, you press on.

On a **miss**, also suffer -1 momentum. If you are at 0 spirit, you must mark shaken or corrupted (if currently unmarked) or roll on the following table.

| Roll  | Result                                                                            |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-10  | You are overwhelmed. _Face Desolation_.                                           |
| 11-25 | You give up. Forsake Your Vow (if possible, one relevant to your current crisis). |
| 26-50 | You give in to a fear or compulsion, and act against your better instincts.       |
| 51-00 | You persevere.                                                                    |
