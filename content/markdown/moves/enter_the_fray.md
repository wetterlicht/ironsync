When **you enter into combat**, set the rank of each of your foes.

- Troublesome foe: 3 progress per harm; inflicts 1 harm.
- Dangerous foe: 2 progress per harm; inflicts 2 harm.
- Formidable foe: 1 progress per harm; inflicts 3 harm.
- Extreme foe: 2 ticks per harm; inflicts 4 harm.
- Epic foe: 1 tick per harm; inflicts 5 harm.

Then, roll to determine who is in control. If you are...

- Facing off against your foe: Roll +heart.
- Moving into position against an unaware foe, or striking without warning: Roll +shadow.
- Ambushed: Roll +wits.

On a **strong hit**, take +2 momentum. You have initiative.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

- Bolster your position: Take +2 momentum.
- Prepare to act: Take initiative.

On a **miss**, combat begins with you at a disadvantage. _Pay the Price_. Your foe has initiative.
