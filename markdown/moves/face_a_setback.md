When **your momentum is at its minimum** (-6), and you suffer additional -momentum, choose one.

- Exchange each additional -momentum for any combination of -health, -spirit, or -supply as appropriate to the circumstances.
- Envision an event or discovery (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure) which undermines your progress in a current quest, journey or fight. Then, for each additional -momentum, clear 1 unit of progress on that track per its rank (troublesome=clear 3 progress; dangerous=clear 2 progress; formidable=clear 1 progress; extreme=clear 2 ticks; epic=clear 1 tick).
