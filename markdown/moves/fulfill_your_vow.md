**_Progress Move_**

When **you achieve what you believe to be the fulfillment of your vow**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a **strong hit**, your quest is complete. Mark experience (troublesome=1; dangerous=2; formidable=3; extreme=4; epic=5).

On a **weak hit**, there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. Envision what you discover (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure). Then, mark experience (troublesome=0; dangerous=1; formidable=2; extreme=3; epic=4). You may _Swear an Iron Vow_ to set things right. If you do, add +1.

On a **miss**, your quest is undone. Envision what happens (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and choose one.

- You recommit: Clear all but one filled progress, and raise the questâ€™s rank by one (if not already epic).
- You give up: _Forsake Your Vow_.
