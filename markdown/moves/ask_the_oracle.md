When **you seek to resolve questions, discover details in the world, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events**, you may…

- Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
- Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a ‘yes’, and roll on the table below to check the answer.
- Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as ‘likely’, and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.
- Spark an idea: Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

| Odds           | The answer is ‘yes’ if you roll... |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Almost Certain | 11 or greater                      |
| Likely         | 26 or greater                      |
| 50/50          | 51 or greater                      |
| Unlikely       | 76 or greater                      |
| Small Chance   | 91 or greater                      |

On a match, an extreme result or twist has occurred.
