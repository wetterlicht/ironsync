When **you attempt to persuade someone to do something**, envision your approach and roll. If you...

- Charm, pacify, barter, or convince: Roll +heart (add +1 if you share a bond).
- Threaten or incite: Roll +iron.
- Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow.

On a **strong hit**, theyâ€™ll do what you want or share what they know. Take +1 momentum. If you use this exchange to Gather Information, make that move now and add +1.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but they ask something of you in return. Envision what they want (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure).

On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand which costs you greatly. _Pay the Price_.
