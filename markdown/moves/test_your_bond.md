When **your bond is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, this test has strengthened your bond. Choose one.

- Take +1 spirit.
- Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, your bond is fragile and you must prove your loyalty. Envision what they ask of you (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and do it (or _Swear an Iron Vow_). If you refuse or fail, clear the bond and _Pay the Price_.

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, clear the bond and _Pay the Price_.
