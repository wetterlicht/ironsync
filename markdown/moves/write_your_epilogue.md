**_Progress Move_**

When **you retire from your life as Ironsworn**, envision two things: What you hope for, and what you fear. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your bonds. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a **strong hit**, things come to pass as you hoped.

On a **weak hit**, your life takes an unexpected turn, but not necessarily for the worse. You find yourself spending your days with someone or in a place you did not foresee. Envision it (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure).

On a **miss**, your fears are realized.
