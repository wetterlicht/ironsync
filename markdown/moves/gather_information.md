When **you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation, or follow a track**, roll +wits. If you act within a community or ask questions of a person with whom you share a bond, add +1.

On a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn (_Ask the Oracle if unsure_), and take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, the information complicates your quest or introduces a new danger. Envision what you discover (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and take +1 momentum.

On a **miss**, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. _Pay the Price_.
