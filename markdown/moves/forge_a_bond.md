name: Forge A Bond
type: Relationship

When **you spend significant time with a person or community, stand together to face hardships, or make sacrifices for their cause**, you can attempt to create a bond. When you do, roll +heart. If you make this move after you successfully _Fulfill Your Vow_ to their benefit, you may reroll any dice.

On a **strong hit**, make note of the bond, mark a tick on your bond progress track, and choose one.

- Take +1 spirit.
- Take +2 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, they ask something more of you first. Envision what it is (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), do it (or _Swear an Iron Vow_), and mark the bond. If you refuse or fail, _Pay the Price_.
On a miss, they reject you. _Pay the Price_.
