**_Progress Move_**

When **you make a move to take decisive action**, and score a **strong hit**, you may resolve the outcome of this fight. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a **strong hit**, this foe is no longer in the fight. They are killed, out of action, flee, or surrender as appropriate to the situation and your intent (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure).

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must also choose one.

- It’s worse than you thought: _Endure Harm_.
- You are overcome: _Endure Stress_.
- Your victory is short-lived: A new danger or foe appears, or an existing danger worsens.
- You suffer collateral damage: Something of value is lost or broken, or someone important must pay the cost.
- You’ll pay for it: An objective falls out of reach.
- Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance.

On a **miss**, you have lost this fight. _Pay the Price_.
