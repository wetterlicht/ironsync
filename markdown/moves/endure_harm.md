name: Endure Harm
type: Suffer

When **you face physical damage**, suffer -health equal to your foeâ€™s rank or as appropriate to the situation. If your health is 0, suffer -momentum equal to any remaining -health.
Then, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

- Shake it off: If your health is greater than 0, suffer -1 momentum in exchange for +1 health.
- Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you press on.

On a **miss**, also suffer -1 momentum. If you are at 0 health, you must mark wounded or maimed (if currently unmarked) or roll on the following table.

| Roll  | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1-10  | The harm is mortal. Face Death.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11-20 | You are dying. You need to Heal within an hour or two, or Face Death.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21-35 | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to a foe not inclined to show mercy, Face Death.                                                 |
| 36-50 | You are reeling and fighting to stay conscious. If you engage in any vigorous activity (such as running or fighting) before taking a breather for a few minutes, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move). |
| 51-00 | You are battered but still standing.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
