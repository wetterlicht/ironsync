When **you are brought to the brink of death, and glimpse the world beyond**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, death rejects you. You are cast back into the mortal world.

On a **weak hit**, choose one.

- You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
- Death desires something of you in exchange for your life. Envision what it wants (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and _Swear an Iron Vow_ (formidable or extreme) to complete that quest. If you fail to score a hit when you _Swear an Iron Vow_, or refuse the quest, you are dead. Otherwise, you return to the mortal world and are now cursed. You may only clear the cursed debility by completing the quest.

On a **miss**, you are dead.
